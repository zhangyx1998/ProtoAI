## Data

The following is a sequence of packets and user hints captured from a communication protocol. Each entry contains:

- **DATA-UP/DATA-DOWN packets**: Raw binary data with timestamp and payload (hex format)
- **USER-HINT entries**: Human-provided context about what was happening at specific timestamps

Please analyze this data to understand the communication protocol structure and infer the meaning of different packet fields.
The response structure should follow the following for each packet that is either DATA-UP or DATA-DOWN. 
No other suggestions needs to be provided.

### Response Structure:

type InferredPacketProperties = {
    readonly title: string; // A concise name for the packet type
    readonly description: string; // Concise description of the packet's role or purpose within the protocol
    readonly confidence: number; // Confidence level of the inference (0 to 1)
    readonly fields: BinaryField[];
};

type BinaryField = {
    // Name of the field
    readonly name: string;
    // Description of the field's purpose
    readonly description: string;
    // Start and end position of the field in bits
    // Adjacent fields must not overlap, but they may or may not
    //  be contiguous
    readonly range: [number, number];
};

### Combined Data Array:

**Entry 1:**
- Type: DATA-DOWN
- Timestamp: 10
- Payload: 24 4D 3C 00 01 01

**Entry 2:**
- Type: DATA-UP
- Timestamp: 20
- Payload: 24 4D 3E 03 01 00 01 2D 2E

**Entry 3:**
- Type: DATA-DOWN
- Timestamp: 30
- Payload: 24 4D 3C 00 04 04

**Entry 4:**
- Type: DATA-UP
- Timestamp: 40
- Payload: 24 4D 3E 04 04 42 45 54 41 12

**Entry 5:**
- Type: USER-HINT
- Timestamp: 50
- Context: "the flight controller is initiated"

**Entry 6:**
- Type: DATA-DOWN
- Timestamp: 60
- Payload: 24 4D 3C 01 4D 02 4E

**Entry 7:**
- Type: USER-HINT
- Timestamp: 70
- Context: "the robot is moving forward right now"

### Additional Context:

- DATA-DOWN packets represent data sent from a controller/host to a device
- DATA-UP packets represent data sent from a device back to the controller/host
- USER-HINT entries provide contextual information about system state at specific timestamps, be aware that the user input is slower than the data packets because of human reaction time
- All payload data is represented in hexadecimal format
- Timestamps are in some unit of time
